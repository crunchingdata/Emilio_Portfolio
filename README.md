# [Python Project 1: Estimator of weekly return on share price](https://github.com/crunchingdata/Estimator_of_weekly_return_on_share_price)
* Created a tool that estimates the return per calendar week of a share to help private investors get a broad timing for orders over the year.
* Implemented an exponential decay to optimize Exponential Moving Average (EMA).
* Built various models to reach best forecast through (equal) weighted average for weekly return.

# [Python Project 2: Linear regression - math vs. machine learning](https://github.com/crunchingdata/Linear_regression_-_math_vs_machine_learning)
* Implemented linear regression for revenue prognostic through machine learning and math.
* Controlled accuracy of the linear regression through MSE, MAE, coefficient of determination and RMSE.
* Compared linear regression trough machine learning with linear regression through math.

# [Power BI Project 1: Visualization of Covid-19 data](https://github.com/crunchingdata/Emilio_Portfolio/tree/main)

* Implemented pie, line and area chart with cards to display insights of the dataset [owid-covid-data.csv](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data).  
* Splitted the dataset for distinguishing actual status, if import is refreshed, and historical developements for better performance.
* First worked with the dataset as a downloaded .csv-file, afterwards replaced the source with the conection to the automatically updated file from the [GiHub-Repository](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data).

# [Power BI Project 2: Visualization of sales on fruits and vegetables](https://github.com/crunchingdata/Emilio_Portfolio/tree/main)
* Implemented funnel, line, area, bar, donut chart and scatter plot with cards to display insights of the dataset [Fruit Sales Data - Inventory and Sales.xlsx](https://github.com/aapci/Fruit-Sales-Data-Analysis).  
* Merged the dataset and removed inconsistencies from it without deleting data.

# [Power BI & Python Project 1: Cancer prediction with Machine Learning Classification](https://crunchingdata.github.io/Cancer_Prediction_ML_Python_and_Power_BI/)
* Trained Extrem Gradient Boosting ML-Model on Python with Pycaret and exported it.
* Applied in Power BI the trained Extrem Gradient Boosting ML-model for measuring performance with metrics numerically as visually on train dataset and for prediction on unseen dataset.
* Created a Anaconda environment for Power BI and connected Power BI Desktop to it. User Interface of Power BI Service can not display directly Python visuals, for display use Power BI Desktop.
