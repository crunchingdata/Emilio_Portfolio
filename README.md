# [Python Project 1: Estimator of weekly return on share price](https://github.com/crunchingdata/Estimator_of_weekly_return_on_share_price)
* Created a tool that estimates the return per calendar week of a share to help private investors get a broad timing for orders over the year.
* Implemented an exponential decay to optimize Exponential Moving Average (EMA).
* Built various models to reach best forecast through (equal) weighted average for weekly return.

# [Python Project 2: Linear regression - math vs. machine learning](https://github.com/crunchingdata/Linear_regression_-_math_vs_machine_learning)
* Implemented linear regression for revenue prognostic through machine learning and math.
* Controlled accuracy of the linear regression through MSE, MAE, coefficient of determination and RMSE.
* Compared linear regression trough machine learning with linear regression through math.
