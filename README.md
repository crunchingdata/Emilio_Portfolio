# Project 1 overview: Estimator of weekly return on share price
* Created a tool that estimates the return per calendar week of a share to help investors get a broad timing for orders over the year. 
* Implemented a search engine that permits access to identification of most shares on the market from API https://www.alphavantage.co/
* Working per share on about like in example ING~[5877 rows x 9 columns] covering 20+ years of historical data from same API.
** cleaned data to daily open and close prices and transformed them to daily return with Python and library Pandas.
